## Using Heck Utilities
One of the goals of Heck Utilities is to be totally easy to integrate. For that reason, properties in the library have low specificity and no `!important` tags, so as to allow for code to be overwritten. To integrate, simply `<link>` in your HTML document's `<head>`, and use the available classes in your HTML! Style away!
